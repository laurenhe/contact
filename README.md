# Contact

How to play:

  * 3+ players
  * Word keeper picks a word and provides first letter of the word as well as its length
  * Guessers can make guesses at any time
  * A guesser can think of a word starting with the same letter as the keeper's word but can be any length and describe it to the other players 
  * Keeper can guess the guesser's word at any time
  * If other guesser(s) think they know the guesser's word, they shout out 'Contact!' and counting down 3, 2, 1 guesser and other guesser(s) say the word in mind at the       same time
  * If the word is the same and the keeper has not guessed the right word, the keeper will give the next letter in their word and the process repeats
  * Guessers will have to come up with words and corresponding descriptions starting with the first two letters of the keeper's word

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Requirements

  * Elixir 1.11.2
